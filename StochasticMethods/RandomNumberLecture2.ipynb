    "Now we have looked at several techniques for drawing random numbers from distributions which are uniform, or non-uniform, let's pause to consider them a bit more.  How do we know that the \"random\" numbers we are getting are random enough?  We already know that they can't ever be considered truly random, but surely there is some way to say with confidence that the numbers we obtain are good enough.  To do that, we can apply a series of statistical tests on a large sample of random numbers to see if they are statistically sound.  \n",

It measures the similarlty between two sets of data and determines the probability they are drawn from the same parent distribution. Like in the Chi-squared test, we don't want the match to be too perfect, but the distributions should be not too different either, and determining the range of acceptable values depends on the application.
